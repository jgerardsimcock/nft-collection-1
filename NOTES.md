What was learned so far

Oppen Zepplin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Zeppelin has a good tool called [wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to help set up the initial template. This will give you alot of boiler plate code out of the gate. This was how I set up my NFT from the beginning. 


Foundry
~~~~~~~

I prefer to use Foundry for tests since it uses Solidity and I can stay in this language. Testing is much easier and faster. 


[This](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solmate-nft) is helpful


Wallets and test Eth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup an Alchemy account and create a wallet in Metamask. In your settings, enable test networks and choose Goerli from the dropdown menu. This should give you a goerli testnet wallet address. You can then go to Alchemy Faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/) and get some test Eth.
