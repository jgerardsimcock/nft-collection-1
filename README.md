First collectoin of NFTs. Deploying to ethereum mainnet. 





Here is how this has to work

Some process to deploy to Arweave and get base URL and have that URI returned
Poll the Arweave blockchain until we receive the locatoin of our file

Once we have the file location we can mint the nft associated with that along with the attrs etc

How can I mint basically one of ones and then set the uri after the fact.




* Set up an alchemy account or an Infura account 
* Create a wallet and get your Goerli account address from [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

* Install Foundry
* Write your nft contract 
* write tests
* deploy to testnet 

* deploy to polygon or arbitrum/optimism
